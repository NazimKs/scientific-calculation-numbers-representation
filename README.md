# Numbers Representation
This activity aims to understand how a number (natural integer, relative integer or real) can be represented in the memory of a computer.

Through this activity, we are interested in:
  - Decomposition of natural numbers in base of 2 , 10 , 16.
  - Different conversions from one base to another.
  - Machine representation of whole numbers (natural, relative).
  - Machine representation of decimal numbers (floating numbers, the IEEE 754 standard).
  - Calculations on floating numbers.
  - Rounding errors due to base changes.
